## Objective

You have to be the fastest player and make the best time in a lap.

## Sensors

We have implemented 6 sensors for this game. 4 are made for the checkpoints.
The 4 checkpoints are around the map, when you reach one a coin sounds. If you reach a checkpoint and the car goes out of the map you will respawn in the last checkpoint you have reached.
The 2 remaining are the sensors for the finish line. One is made for starting the race against the clock. The other one is to stop the race against the clock.

## How I know the time that i've made?

In a small window you will see the time that is currently counting in the actual lap, the best one you've made in all of the laps done and the time of the past lap.

## Controls

To move the car you must use the arrow keys. 

The up one to go forward.

The left one to go to the left.

The right one to go to the right.

The down one to brake and if you keep pushing it you will go backward.
